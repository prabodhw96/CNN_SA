# Sentiment Analysis using CNN
## Overview
In this notebook, we train a deep learning model to train a classifier on IMDB data set using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Convolutional layers extract higher level feature in images. Moreover, they also work in most 2D problems. CNN trains 50% to 60% faster than LSTMs on this problem.

## Dependencies
Install the following dependencies using pip:
* numpy
* keras

## Result
**Accuracy:** 86.6%
